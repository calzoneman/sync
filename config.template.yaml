# Define IPs/ports to listen on
# Each entry MUST define ip and port (ip can be '' to bind all available addresses)
# Each entry should set http, https, and/or io to true to listen for the corresponding
# service on that port.  http/io and https/io can be combined, but if http and https
# are both specified, only https will be bound to that port.
#
# If you don't specify a url, the url io.domain:port or https.domain:port will be assumed
# for non-ssl and ssl websockets, respectively.  You can override this by specifying the
# url for a websocket listener.
