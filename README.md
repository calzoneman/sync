CyTube
======

CyTube is a project I started in early 2013 as a hobby project to build my own
clone of synchtube.com (which shut down in March 2013).

The basic concept is that users register channels where connected viewers can
watch videos from different video hosts (e.g., YouTube, Twitch) and the playback
is synchronized for all the viewers in the channel.

Each channel has a playlist where users can queue up videos to play, as well as
an integrated chatroom for discussion.

The official server is located at https://cytu.be, but there are other public
servers hosted for various communities.

## Installation

The installation guide for server administrators is located [on the
wiki](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/wiki/CyTube-3.0-Installation-Guide).
