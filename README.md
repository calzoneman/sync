About
-----

CyTube is a web application providing media synchronization, chat, and more for an arbitrary number of channels.
I began developing this as a hobby project, and when synchtube.com announced their closure, I
began polishing it and readying it for the public.

I am hosting a CyTube server at http://cytu.be

The serverside is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.JS.  It makes use
of a MySQL database to store user registrations, cached media metadata, and
data about each channel.

The clientside is written in JavaScript and makes use of Socket.IO and
jQuery as well as the APIs for various media providers.
The web interface uses Bootstrap for layout and styling.
